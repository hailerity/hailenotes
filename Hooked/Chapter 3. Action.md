The next step in Hook is the action phase.
The trigger, driven by internal or external cues, informs the user of what to do next; however, if the user does not take action, the trigger is useless.

# Action Versus Inaction
Is there a formula for behavior? It turns out that there is.
> Fogg posits that there are three ingredients required to initiate any and all behaviors: (1) the user must have sufficient motivation; (2) the user must have the ability to complete desired action; and (3) a trigger must be present to activate the behavior.

The Fogg Behavior Model is represented in the formula B = MAT

# Motivation
While a trigger cues an action, motivation defines the level of desire that action.
*motivation as "the energy for action."*

Three Motivators drive our desire to act
+ to seek pleasure and avoid pain
+ to seek hope and avoid fear
+ to seek social acceptance and avoid rejection

Motivation Examples in Advertising

+ Victoria's Secret lingerie
+ Carl's Jr. and Burger King

# Ability
First lay out the steps the customer must take to get the job done, once the series of tasks from intention to outcome is understood, simply start removing steps until you reach the simplest possible process.

> Consequently, any technology or product that significantly reduces the steps to complete a task will enjoy high adoption rates by the people it assists.
