# Habit Testing
The process of developing successful habit-forming technologies requires patience and persistence.

> The Hook Model can be a helpful tool for filtering out bad ideas with low habit potential as well as a framework for identifying room for improvement in existing products.

> Building a habit-forming product is an iterative process and requires user-behavior analysis and continuous experimentation.

## Step 1: Identify
> First define what it means to be a devoted user. How often "should" one use your product?

## Step 2: Codify
> You are looking for a Habit Path - a series of similar actions shared by your most loyal users.

For example, in its early days, Twitter discovered that once new users followed thirty other members, they hit a tipping point that dramatically increased the odds they would keep using the site.

## Step 3: Modify

> Tracking users by cohort and comparing their activity with that of habitual users should guide how product evolve and improve.
