## External Triggers
Call to Action

> External triggers are embedded with information, which tells the user what to do next.

+ "Thirsty?" in the Coca-Cola vending machine
+ "Log in to Mint" prompt in the email from Mint.com

More choices require the user to evaluate multiple options. Too many choices or irrelevant options can cause hesitation, confusion, or worse - abandonment.

External triggers can also convey implicit information about the next desired user action. For example, Web site links are for clicking and app icons are for tapping.

## Types of External Triggers
Companies can utilize four types of external triggers to move users to complete dsired actions

### 1. Paid Triggers
Advertising, search engine marketing, other paid channels...

Paid triggers can be effective but costly ways to keep users coming back.

Because paying for reengagement is unsustainable for most business models, companies generally use paid triggers to accquire new users and then leverage other triggers to bring them back.

### 2. Earned Triggers
Are free in that they cannot be bought directly, but they often require investment in the form of time spent on public and media relations.

For earned triggers to drive ongoing user acquisition, companies must keep their products in the limelight - a difficult and unpredictable task.

### 3. Relationship Triggers
One person telling others about a product or service can be highly effective external trigger for action.

Electronic invitation, a facebook 'like', word of mouth, product referrals...

Relationship triggers can
+ Create the viral hyper-growth entrepreneurs and investors lust after
+ Drive growth because people love to tell one another about a wonderful offer

Proper use of relationship triggers requires building an engaged user base that is enthusiastic about sharing the benefits of the product with others.

### 4. Owned Triggers
Consume a piece of real estate in the user's environment.
+ An app icon on the user's phone screen
+ An e-mail newsletter to which the user subscribes
+ App update notification

Owned triggers are only set after users sign up for an account, submit their e-mail address, intall an app, opt in to newsletters...

While paid, earned, and relationship triggers drive new user acquisition, owned triggers prompt repeat engagement until a habit is formed.


Yet external triggers are only the first step. The ultimate goal of all external triggers is to propel users into and through the Hook Model... When users form habits, they are cued by a different kind of trigger: internal ones.

## Internal Triggers
When a product becomes tightly coupled with a thought, an emotion, or a preexisting routine, it leverages and internal trigger.

> Internal triggers manifest automatically in your mind. Connecting internal triggers with a product is the brass ring of consumer technology.

Emotions, particularly negative ones, are powerful internal triggers and greatly influence our daily routines.

Positive emotions can also serve as internal triggers, and may even be triggered themselves by a need to satisfy something that is bothering us. After all, we use products to find solutions to problems.

As product designers, it is our goal to solve these problems and eliminate pain - to scratch the user's itch.

> Gradually, these bonds cement into a habit as users turn to your product when experiencing certain internal triggers.

The study (A study at the Missouri University of Science and Technology) demonstrated that people suffering from symptoms of depression used the Internet more. Why is that? One hypothesis is that those with depression experience negative emotions more  frequently than the general population and seek relief by turning to technology to lift their mood.

One we're hooked, using these products does not always require an explicit call to action. Instead, they rely upon our automatic responses to feelings that precipitate the desired behavior.

> In the case of internal triggers, the information about what to do next is encoded as a learned association in the user's memory.

The association between an internal trigger and your product, however, is not formed overnight. It can take weeks or months of frequent usage for internal triggers to latch onto cues. New habits are sparked by external triggers, but associations with internal triggers are what keeps users hooked.

## Building for Triggers
Product designers must know their user's internal triggers - that is, the pain they seek to solve.

Finding customers' internal triggers requires learning more about people than what they can tell you in a survey, though. It requires digging deeper to understand how your users feel

> The ultimate goal of a habit-forming product is to solve the user's pain by creating an association so that the user identifies the company's product or service as the source of relief.

First, the company must identify the particular frustration or pain point in emotional terms, rather than product features.

“We often think the Internet enables you to do new things . . . But people just want to do the same things they’ve always done.” - Evan Williams - cofounder of Blogger and Twitter.

People themselves don't know which emotions motivate them. People just don't think in these terms.

"When the research focuses on what people actually do (watch cat videos) rather than what they wish they did (produce cinema-quality home movies) it actually expands possibilities."

“[If] you want to build a product that is relevant to folks, you need to put yourself in their shoes and you need to write a story from their side. So, we spend a lot of time writing what’s called user narratives.” - Jack Dorsey

One method is to try asking the question "Why?" as many times as it takes to get to an emotion.
