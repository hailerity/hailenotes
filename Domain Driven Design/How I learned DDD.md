# How I learned DDD?

## 1. Firstly, I looked at the DDD Quickly (Vietnamese, also English), but I didn't think It's good to start

### Why it's not a good tutorial?
+ Doesn't draw a clear road map to go
+ The indexes are not sexy
+ The layout is not fancy

## 2. I looked for online course, and saw that the DDD Fundamental on PluralSight is quite good
So I decided to start with DDD Fundamental Course on PluralSight

### Why I choose?
+ Eric Evans involved in the course
+ Curriculum is clear
+ I can foresee what I can get from this course
+ Like the way they structured the content

### How I learned
+ Going through first chapter was quite good, terms are easy to understand and I know why I should know those terms
+ Going through second chapter was ok, there something misunderstanding, I didn't know why I have to know those terms
+ Going through third chapter, it started harder, I thought that I lost something on the way
+ Really hard to pass through the rest of the course, especially the two last chapters
+ After finish the course, I have a lots of terms in my head, but I didn't have something clear about it. I thought what I need was a process to do DDD, or a picture of DDD implementation

## 3. I went to slideshare, grab any slide about DDD and read
I got some more ideas, like DDD go along with Agile, but I also didn't have a clear picture

## 4. I searched for DDD examples
and got some example projects, in java and in ruby, I got clearer about how to implement DDD like it has some layers: domain, application, view, infrastructure,

## 4.1. I read an article about DDD
http://www.developerfusion.com/article/9794/domain-driven-design-a-step-by-step-guide-part-1/
http://www.developerfusion.com/article/10077/domain-driven-design-a-step-by-step-guide-part-2/

At first, I feel like it will help me be more understood terms of DDD

Finally, I finished reading that article. It's good. I've just understood more about some terms of DDD.

## 4.2. Let's note down all material references

## 4.3. Read article Domain Driven Design and Development In Practice in InfoQ
Why?
+ So far I have in mind the core concepts of DDD and well understanding of those concepts
+ Now I want to have some ideas about how to implement DDD in practice, it's about what to do, what to do first, what to do second?
+ This article seems good to read

The first sight:
+ Lots useful information: processes
+ Lots of terms

I also looked in to the project
+ Simple
+ Lots of library used in project that I don't know
+ Don't understand some programming techniques: DTO Assembler (maybe it uses library instead of implementing handy)

Next:
+ Read the article again, carefully
+ Dig deep into the project, get to know the library it uses

And finally I finished that article, and I'm satisfied with that
+ A lot of techniques that can be used with DDD
+ A process to implement DDD
+ A lot of new terms


Next
+ Dig deep into the project

Done
+ Not too much but I kind of get the ideas

What to do next?
--> Look into one more java project

##  4.4. I may read this article
[Applied Domain-Driven Design](http://www.zankavtaskin.com/2013/09/applied-domain-driven-design-ddd-part-1.html)

I did read it, first third parts, but I was not interested

## 4.5. Came to http://dddcommunity.org/
Lots of useful stuff here.
It turned out the DDD Sample app in Java is mentioned here, also the DDD Quickly

And lots more books to read

## 4.6. I am going to read DDD Quickly
Why?
+ To understand the Cargo domain

It's going to take 3 hours to read or more

Ok, let's get started with DDD Quicly

Until now, I have read half of it, and I feel good. I think that I read it at right time. Because it explains deeply each term.

Almost finish, back to the rest later

## 5. I think I should look deep into some projects
to undertand how did they implement DDD
And I should dive into a Ruby project, because I'm familiar with it

Ok, let's pull down the DDD Sample in Ruby


## 6. Going to implement in a project

I am applying ddd into refactoring Marketing Online service.

After a few step, I got trouble.

I have no domain expert, actually I don't know who is domain expert. This service is not really for customer, it's quite technical.

I try to use domain expert language, but sometime I realize that I use technical language.

Now, I have to decide whether I should keep moving on or back to concepts to understand more, or have a discussion with someone else. Come back later.
