## 1. Introduction

### Introduction

### What is a Service?
What is a service?

From the monolithic

**Service** is a piece of software which basically provides functionality to other pieces of software within your system. The other pieces of software could be anything from website to mobile or a desktop app.

**The communication** between software components and the services normally happen over network using some kind of communication protocol.

A system which uses a service or multiple services in this fashion is known to have a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Instead using package modules within each client application, use a service to provide functionality.

**The Microservices architecture** is basically an improved version of SOA, of scalability, reusability, and standardized contracts and interface for backwards compatibility, and the idea of having a service that's stateless.

### Microservices Introduction
SOA done well, a revolution of SOA
+ Knowing how to size a service
+ Traditional SOA resulted in monolithic services

Micro sized services provide
+ Efficiently scalable applications
+ Flexible applications
+ High performance applications

Introduce a new set of addition design principles which teach you how to size a service correctly.

Application powered by multiple services

Small services with a single focus

Lightweight communication mechanism
+ Both client to server and server to server

Technology agnostic API

Independent data storage

Distributed transaction

Centralized tooling for management

### The Monolithic
Typical enterprise application

### Emergence of Microservices
