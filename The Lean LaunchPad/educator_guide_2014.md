# 1. The Lean Startup Manifesto
Startups are not smaller versions of large companies.

Existing companies execute a business model, startups search for one. The distinction is at the heart of the Lean Startup approach. It shapes the lean definition of a startup: a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.

## The Lean Startup: Key Principles
+ First, The foundation of the Lean Startup is evidence-based entrepreneurship... founders summarize their hypotheses in a framework called a **Business Model Canvas**
+ Second, Lean Startups use a "get out of the building" approach called **Customer Development** to test their hypotheses and collect evidence about whether they are true or false.
+ Third, Lean Startups practice something called **Agile Development**, which originated in the software industry. Agile development works hand-in-hand with Customer Development.

## Strategy: Business Model to Operating Plan
From unknown business model, going to test hypotheses, searching to verify the business model components. Once the business model is known, new ventures benefit from creating a business plan to determine and communicate how the business will be executed.

A Business Model describes how a company creates, delivers, and captures value.

The primary objective of a startup is to **validate its business model hypotheses** until it finds one that is **repeatable and scalable**.

## Process: Customer and Agile Development to Product Management
The process used to organize and implement the search for the business model are a combination of Customer Development and Agile Development

+ **Customer Discovery**: first captures the founders' vision and turns it into a series of business model hypotheses.
+ **Customer Validation**: tests whether the resulting business model is repeatable and scalable.
+ **Customer Creation** is the beginning of execution
+ **Company-building** transitions the organization from a startup to a company focused on executing a validated model

## Organization: Customer Development Team to Functional Organization
Once a company has found a business model, the organization "graduates" from startup status and moves from search mode to execution

The idea of not having a functional organization until the organization has found a proven business model is one of the hardest thing for most new startups to grasp. The are no sales, marketing, or business development departments when you are searching for a business model.

## Education: Search to Execution

## Instructional Strategy: Static to Dynamic
Changing the focus of the class experience from **case method to hands-on experience**.

As much as possible, the curricular emphasis ought to be on experiential, learner-centric, and inquiry-based classes that help to develop the mindset, reflexes, agility, and resilience and entrepreneur needs to search for certainty in a chaotic world.

# 10. Class Culture

> This class pushes many people past their comfort zone. If you believe that your role of your
instructors is to praise in public and criticize in private, you’re in the wrong class. Do not take
this class. If you come from a culture where receiving critiques that may feel abrupt and
brusque in front of your peers—weekly—embarrasses you, do not take this class. It’s not
personal, but it is by design a part of the class to emulate the pace, uncertainty, and
pressures of a startup. In return, we also expect you to question us, challenge our point of
view if you disagree, and engage in a real dialog with the teaching team.

> This class pushes many people past their comfort zone. But this is what startups are like (and
the class is just a small part of the startup experience). The pace and the uncertainty pick up as
the class proceeds
